/// Sobel Edge Algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
/// The Sobel operator is used in image processing, particularly within edge detection algorithms. 
/// Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient 
/// of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Sobel operator is 
/// either the corresponding gradient vector or the norm of this vector. The Sobel operator is based on 
/// convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer valued filter in horizontal and vertical 
/// direction and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations. 
/// On the other hand, the gradient approximation which it produces is relatively crude, in particular 
/// for high frequency variations in the image.
/// The operator uses two 3Ã—3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate approximations 
/// of the derivatives - one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical. 
/// Gx and Gy are two images which at each point contain the horizontal and vertical derivative approximations
